We performed for both xomo10000 and pom310000 files all and incremental and calculated and tabulated the baseline and same scores.
We found that for finding probes for AFTER for the first all Tree all the probes were found(20 iterations*100 probes=2000) as the whole dataset was used.

Meanwhile for the incremental trees this wasnt the case. As we are performing incremental based on anomaly its not sure that all probes will be present,
Its based on the dribbling of rows , groupping of clusters (random() shuffling) which may or may not be anomolous w.r.t 500 initial rows
For incremental tree the scores were based on the probes AFTER which for instance for alpha 0.5 for xomofile came to be 20 outof 2000.
   
We see that score mostly increases with aplha. We can see that number of probes seem to be mostly increasing as alpha increased which in turn affects 
the score of incremental tree.
We also found that the incremental score was less than baseline and many times less than half or half the value of baseline.
